1) What methods would a class that implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface
   have to implement?
   a) charAt, length, subSequence, and toString.

2) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface SomethingIsWrong {
       
      void aMethod(int aValue){
        System.out.println("Hi Mom");
      }
    }
A)an interface should not contain method definiton
3) Fix the interface in question 2.
default void aMethod(int aValue){
        System.out.println("Hi Mom");
      }
4) Is the following interface valid?
   
   public interface Marker {
   
   }
